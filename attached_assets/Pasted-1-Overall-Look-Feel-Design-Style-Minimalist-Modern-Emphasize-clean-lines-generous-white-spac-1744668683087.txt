1. Overall Look & Feel
Design Style

Minimalist & Modern: Emphasize clean lines, generous white space, and clear visual hierarchy.

Card-Based Layouts: Present key content in “cards” or panels to group related information.

Color Palette

Primary Color: A versatile blue, e.g., #167EF8 (conveys trust and professionalism).

Accent Color: A vibrant orange or teal, e.g., #FF8F3E or #00BFA6, for CTAs and highlights.

Neutral Tones: Light gray #F5F6FA for backgrounds; darker gray #333333 for text.

Hover/Interaction Color: Slightly darker shade of the primary color, e.g., #1265C0, to indicate interactive elements.

Typography

Primary Font: Inter or Montserrat for a modern, legible sans-serif style.

Hierarchy & Weights:

Headings (H1–H3): Use bold weight (700).

Subheadings/Section Titles (H4–H6): Use medium weight (500–600).

Recommended Sizes:

H1: ~36–40px

H2: ~28–32px

H3: ~22–24px

Layout Approach

Responsive Grid or Flexbox: A 12-column grid (common in frameworks like Bootstrap) ensures consistency.
