1. Layout & Spacing
Goal: Achieve a well-balanced, consistent appearance.

Use a consistent grid: Adopt a spacing system (e.g., multiples of 8px) so margins, padding, and spacing between elements feel aligned and intentional.

Group related items: If these “boxes” relate to a common set of actions or concepts (like an SEO checklist), consider grouping them in sections or cards that share a distinct container style.

2. Visual Hierarchy
Goal: Make the most important information stand out immediately.

Prominent headings: The card title (“5. URL Structure”) is a key piece of information. Use a larger, bolder font for it.

Subtitle or descriptive text: Keep the short explanation in a secondary text style (smaller, lighter, or slightly muted color) to reinforce hierarchy.

Clear numbering or ordering: If the sequence (5, 6, 7, etc.) is crucial, ensure it’s visually separated (maybe in a small badge or subtle accent color) so it’s easy to scan.

3. Color & Contrast
Goal: Maintain accessibility standards and use color effectively.

Use minimal background colors:

Instead of heavy blocks of color, consider a lighter background or a subtle accent.

Reserve bolder colors for hover states or important statuses.

High contrast for text: Ensure text meets WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1 for normal text). If you are using light backgrounds, the text should be dark enough to be easily readable.

Consistent color palette: Stick to a defined color palette (brand primary, secondary, neutral grays). This unifies the design across all cards.

4. Typography
Goal: Improve readability and create a refined, professional feel.

Minimal font families: Stick to one or two typefaces (header + body).

Use weights and sizes to create depth: Titles could be semi-bold or bold, descriptive text regular weight, and possibly a different color for subtlety.

Line height & letter spacing: Ensure sufficient line height (1.4–1.6) for body text for easier reading.

5. Card/Box Shape & Style
Goal: Give each box a clean, modern “card” aesthetic.

Soft corners: Apply a subtle border-radius (e.g., 4px–8px) to each card. Too large can feel cartoonish; too small can feel outdated.

Shadows or borders:

A minimal shadow (slight blur, low opacity) can give depth.

Alternatively, a 1px border in a neutral gray can outline each card if a shadow doesn’t align with your brand style.

Hover / focus states: On hover, slightly elevate the card with a smoother box-shadow or shift. This adds interactivity and depth.
