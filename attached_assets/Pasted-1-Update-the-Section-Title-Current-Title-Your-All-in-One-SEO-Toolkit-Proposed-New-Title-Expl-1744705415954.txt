1. Update the Section Title
Current Title: "Your All-in-One SEO Toolkit"

Proposed New Title:

"Explore Key Features of Our SEO Toolkit" (with a brief subtitle or blurb that clarifies there are more features)

Example subtitle: "Below are some highlights of what we check; many more tests and tools run in the background."

Rationale
Rewording the main heading and adding a descriptive subtitle helps users immediately understand these are merely the “highlights” or “core features,” not a comprehensive list.

2. Add a “See All Features” or “View Full List” Link/Button
Placement: Place a clearly visible link or button directly below or alongside the feature boxes.

Label Example: “See All SEO Checks” or “View the Complete List.”

Rationale
A direct CTA ensures users know they can explore more if needed. It also reinforces that what they see here is not the full offering.

3. Visual Indicator of “More” Content
Option A: Use an ellipsis or “+X more checks” in the same grid layout.

Option B: Place a subtle “...” or small arrow icon at the end of the grid to indicate additional items are hidden.

Rationale
A visual cue (like a “+3 more,” “...” or “arrow pointing right”) next to the final featured item in the grid will remind users that the list continues.

4. Refine the Intro/Description Text
Current Short Description: (Not specified, but presumably each box has a short tagline under its title.)

Proposed Wording:

At the top of the section, add a short paragraph:

“These are some of the primary checks our tool performs. In addition, we run numerous advanced tests behind the scenes to give you a complete SEO analysis.”

Rationale
This clarifies up front that these tiles are highlights, while the full depth of the analysis is even greater.

5. Optional: Collapsible/Expandable Section
If space permits and the UI fits an expandable approach:

Make the feature boxes collapsible, so the first row or first few items are visible by default.

Include a “Show More” button to reveal the remaining checks and tools in the same page.

Rationale
This approach keeps the interface uncluttered while explicitly revealing there is a longer list if users choose to expand.

6. Maintain a Consistent Visual Style
Keep the same card/box design for any newly revealed checks or items.

Ensure the entire experience (typography, spacing, button styles) is consistent with your site’s overall design system.

Rationale
Even if more checks are revealed via a “View All” link or a collapsible section, consistent visuals prevent the UI from feeling disjointed.

Summary
Adjust Section Heading and Add a Subtitle to highlight partial listing.

Include a Prominent “View Full List” CTA (button or link).

Use Clear Visual Cues (plus sign, ellipsis, or arrow) indicating more content.

Reinforce With Descriptive Copy clarifying these are highlights only.

Consider a Collapsible Layout for an optional way to reveal the complete list.

Keep Design Elements Consistent throughout any additional sections.
